Welcome to Fueler: a small videogame about completing levels while manoeuvring a cute ship through a circuit of asteroids.

This repository can serve beginners or more advanced developers understand how professional projects could be approached from a scalable point of view. Here we use patterns, system and ways of building, gathered from professionals with years of experience working with Unity.

Also avaliable at [Itch.io](https://guillemsc.itch.io/rockety-rocket).

The game makes heavy use of https://github.com/Juce-Assets, a set of libraries built to reuse common aspects of game development.

## Gameplay

Traverse space with this small spaceship, but be careful, there are a lot of dangers ahead! If you don't drive carefully, you may end up in a million pieces after colliding with one of the asteroids

The ship is affected by zero gravity. Any force you add to it, it will be kept until you add an opposite force. You will need to properly administrate how you spend the ship's energy, since you can end up using it all, and drifting hopelessly through space.

Warning! Some astronauts that were performing some very important investigation got lost in the maze of asteroids and need your help! Collect all the astronauts on a level before reaching the destination.

Space is dangerous and there is so much to do before returning home. Complete the level before the time is up.
